- 👋 Hi, I’m Omar Baracaldo (pbaracal@uniandes.edu.co), music teacher at University of los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.
- 👀 I’m developing music education apps since 2015. I'm interested in eye-ear relation because in academic environments (specially theory subjects) music students have to extract sound from visual musical texts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about audio and MIDI for web and how to buil good interfaces.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on develope good interfaces for user interaction, audio and MIDI for web. I'm working with Vanilla Javascript, flex (CSS) and WebAudioFont (Very gratefully to Surikov´s webaudiofont work). 
- 📫 Feel free to send me an e-mail, I would appreciate your code comments, sugestions, and ideas on this work.
